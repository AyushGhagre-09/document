GIT AND GIT HUB


GIT->Git is version control System tools that help you track the history of code.

Why Git?

1)Distributed Version Control-> Git is distributed version control system.This means every developer has a full copy of respository including its history.

2)Branching and Merging -> Git makes branching and merging operation easy. Developer can work on separate branches ,making changes without affecting main
                           codebase. when the work is completed branches can be merged back into the main branch.

3)History and Tracking Changes-> Git keeps a complete history of changes made to the codebase.

4)Open Source-> Git is Open source software  which means it is free to use and can be customized or extended according to specific needs. 

         

GIT COMMANDS


1)version -> It Will tell the version of git.

 git -- version

2)clone -> It is used to create a copy of a remote repository on local machine
 
 git clone <repository-url>

3)status -> display the state of the code

 git status

  different type of status:-

  untracked->new files that git doesn't yet track

  modified-> changed

  unmodified-> unchanged

  staged -> file is ready to commit

4) Add ->  adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area

          git add <file-name>
             or
          git add .(to add all file)

5)commit-> it is record of change.

        git commit -m "some message"


6)push -> git push origin <branch-name> (upload local repo. content to remote repo.)


7)pull-> git pull origin <branch-name>(upload remote repo. content to local repo.)


8) To make a git repo ->git init





BRANCHES->Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch. When the work is complete, a branch can be merged         
           with main project

9) To check branch ->git branch

10) to rename a branch -> git branch -m  <new-branch-name>

11)to navigate branch-> git checkout <branch-name>


12)to delete branch -> git branch -d <branch-name>

Note:- if we are using current branch so we can't delete that

13) to create new branch and navigate to new branch -> git branch -b <branch-name>


14)difference in branch ->git diff <branch-name>
 
Merging code -> it is used integrate changes  from one branch   to another branch .

15) merge the code any branch -> git merge <branch-name>




16) git remote add origin->It is used to add  remote repository named "origin" to your local git repository.
  
git remote add origin <some-link>

 GITHUB


GitHub->Website that allow developer to store and manage their code using git

Fork in GitHub-> it is used to the copy repository in our  new repository.

Git Pull Request->  A pull request is way to propose changes to code repository on platform like Github.

README.md file-> README file is document that provides the inforamation about project to other developers and users.

.gitignore file ->  .gitignore file is used int git version control to specify which files and directories should you ignored anf not tracked by git
